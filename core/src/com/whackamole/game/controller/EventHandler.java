     *  This is meant to be the controller that handles user input and chooses what to do with it.
     *  E.g. check if the user input is valid and do actions based on it.
     *
     *  Here multiple models may be involved, and also multiple controllers.
     *  E.g. This class should register button clicks (and update models, push states etc.)
     *       This class should register mole clicks when they pop up (and update models)
     *       This class should delegate work to other controllers or directly run methods in the model classes
     *       to change the model states.
     *       This class should delegate work to the SocketHandler class for sending click-data to the server.
     *       (or should that be done directly in this class?
